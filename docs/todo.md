## Change Log
 
Ollam integration is done, so the extension can send a code to the Ollama backend and re-insert the code into the editor. 
The typing is clunky and needs work, which I will do soon
The compile and setup also needs to be ironed out 
the integration is only done for two commands though 
* Improve this code simulates the typing without any Ollama integration
* reWrite with Ollama has the integration with Ollama and works well. 
* Other commands are not implemented and there is only scaffolding done for them 


## P1:
* In the simulated typing, the new lines don't show properly and it needs to be handled 
* Ollama code handler needs to be debugged 


## P2: 
* Create a new icon
