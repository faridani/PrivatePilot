- Customizable templates tailored to individual user preferences and coding styles.

### 4. Enhanced Code Commenting and Documentation
- Automatically generate comprehensive comments and documentation blocks for methods, functions, and classes.
- Provide configurable levels of verbosity based on user needs.

### 5. Integration with Project Management Tools
- Seamlessly integrate with popular project management tools (e.g., Jira, GitHub Issues, Trello).
- Automatically create and update tickets or issues directly from code comments or chat prompts.

---

## Technical Requirements

### Dependencies
- VSCode API (v1.60.0 or later)
- Node.js and TypeScript
- node-fetch for backend HTTP requests

### Configuration Files
- `package.json` includes:
  - View container and view definitions.
  - Activation events.
  - Command definitions.
- `tsconfig.json` setup:
  - Module: CommonJS
  - Target: ES2020
  - Lib: [ES2020, dom]
  - Source maps enabled

---

## User Flow

1. **Activate Extension**: User clicks the "Private Pilot" icon in the VSCode Activity Bar.
2. **Open Chat View**: The chat interface opens in a webview panel.
3. **Input Prompt**: User types their query in the provided text box.
4. **Submit Query**: User clicks "Send" or presses Enter.
5. **Receive Response**: Extension sends prompt to Ollama backend, receives AI-generated response, and displays it within the same webview panel.

---

## UI/UX Requirements

### UI Elements
- Minimalistic and intuitive design for chat view.
- Clearly distinguishable color scheme:
  - User queries displayed in blue.
  - AI responses displayed in green.

### Accessibility
- Keyboard accessibility:
  - Focus management for input and submit actions.

### Responsiveness
- Instantaneous feedback upon query submission.
- Loading indicators during backend communication.

---

## Error Handling

- Display user-friendly error messages if:
  - Backend service (Ollama) is unreachable.
  - User query is empty or improperly formatted.
- Timeout handling (if response exceeds a configurable threshold).

---

## Security Considerations

- Secure HTTP requests (consider using HTTPS if Ollama backend supports it).
- Input validation to prevent injection and other common vulnerabilities.

---

## Testing Requirements

- Unit Tests:
  - Backend integration (mock HTTP responses).
- Integration Tests:
  - VSCode integration and Webview functionality.
- End-to-End Testing:
  - Full interaction scenarios (user prompts and AI responses).

---

## Metrics

- Track usage frequency of the chat feature.
- Monitor response time from backend requests.
- Collect feedback on AI response relevance and accuracy.

---

## Deployment and Versioning

- Release extension updates via VSCode Marketplace.
- Maintain semantic versioning.
- Clearly document release notes with each update.
